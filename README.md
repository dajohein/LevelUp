## 🚀 **Previous: Performance Monitoring Fix (October 15, 2025)**

### ⚡ **Critical Performance Issue Resolved**

- **🎯 Issue Fixed**: Performance monitoring was causing the performance problems it was meant to detect
- **📈 Impact**: Eliminated background processing overhead affecting gameplay smoothness
- **🔧 Solution**: Made performance monitoring opt-in only, disabled automatic intervals
- **🧪 Testing**: Added verification tools accessible via `window.testPerformanceFix()`
- **👨‍💻 Developer UX**: Performance monitoring still available on-demand via browser console

### 🛠️ **Developer Controls (Development Mode)**
```javascript
// Enable performance monitoring when needed:
window.enablePerformanceDebug()

// Get performance analysis:
window.getPerformanceReport()

// Disable when done:
window.disablePerformanceDebug()

// Test that the fix works:
window.testPerformanceFix()
```

**Result**: Smooth gameplay experience with zero background monitoring overhead!
