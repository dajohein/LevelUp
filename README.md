  "flag": "🇩🇪", 
  "words": [
    {
      "id": "de_1",
      "term": "der Hund",
      "definition": "the dog",
      "direction": "definition-to-term"
    },
    {
      "id": "de_2", 
      "term": "die Katze",
      "definition": "the cat",
      "direction": "term-to-definition"
    }
  ]
}
            definition: ["Translation 1", "Translation 2"]
        },
        
        // Words with context
        {
            term: "Contextualized word",
            definition: "Translation",
            context: {
                sentence: "Example sentence using the word",

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Learning System Issues

**Word Groups Not Forming Correctly**
- Minimum 5 words required in module for grouping
- Check console for `[WordGrouping]` logs
- Verify word mastery levels are properly stored

**Spaced Repetition Not Working**
- Check that words have mastery data in localStorage
- Look for console logs starting with `[SpacedRepetition]`
- Clear and restart if needed: `localStorage.clear()`

**Analytics Not Tracking**
- Complete at least one session for data
- Check localStorage under `learning_cache_analytics`
- Verify console logs for analytics updates

**Performance Issues**
- Learning system uses analytics for optimization
- Clear old cache data: Use "Clear Cache" button in storage management
- Reduce browser background tabs if needed

    MINOR: 0.9,                // 10% penalty for minor errors
    MAJOR: 0.7,                // 30% penalty for major errors
    MINIMUM: 0.5               // Minimum 50% of points retained
  }
};
```

### Performance Features

1. **React Optimizations**
   ```typescript
   // Efficient state updates with Redux Toolkit
   const gameSlice = createSlice({
     name: 'game',
     initialState,
     reducers: {
       // Immer for immutable updates
       updateWordProgress: (state, action) => {
         state.wordProgress[action.payload.wordId] = action.payload;
       }
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Persistent Storage Optimization**
   ```typescript
   // Debounced persistence to avoid excessive localStorage writes
   const debouncedSave = debounce((state: RootState) => {
     gameStateStorage.save(state.game);
   }, 1000);
   ```
   }
   ```

## �️ Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. **Setup Development Environment**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dajohein/LevelUp.git
   cd LevelUp
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Making Changes**
   - Write tests first (TDD approach)
   - Follow TypeScript and React best practices
   - Update documentation when needed
   - Run linter: `npm run lint`
   - Format code: `npm run format`

3. **Testing**
   ```bash
   npm test               # Run all tests once
   ```

### Adding Features

1. **New Language Support**
   - Create JSON file in `src/data/` following existing structure
   - Add appropriate language-specific rules in `answerValidation.ts`
   - **CRITICAL**: Implement proper language isolation in storage and Redux state
   - Test with all quiz modes (multiple choice, letter scramble, open-ended)
   - Ensure keyboard input compatibility for special characters
   - **Test cross-language data separation** thoroughly, including browser reloads

2. **Game Mechanics**
   - Add logic to appropriate service files
   - Update Redux slices for state management
   - **Maintain language-scoped state loading** - never merge cross-language data
   - Create or update React components as needed
   - Add TypeScript types in `src/types/`
   - **Implement storage validation** with debug logging for new data structures

### Data Management Best Practices

1. **Language Isolation Patterns**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ CORRECT: Language-scoped storage
   const progress = wordProgressStorage.load(currentLanguage);
   
   // ❌ WRONG: Global mixed storage
   const allProgress = wordProgressStorage.loadAll();
   ```

2. **Redux State Management**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ CORRECT: Load only current language
   const languageProgress = wordProgressStorage.load(savedState.language);
   
   // ❌ WRONG: Load mixed progress into global state
   const mixedProgress = { ...germanProgress, ...spanishProgress };
   ```

3. **Storage Validation**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ CORRECT: Add validation and logging
   save: (languageCode: string, data: Record<string, WordProgress>) => {
     logger.debug(`Saving ${Object.keys(data).length} items for ${languageCode}`);
     // Validation logic...
   }
   ```

## � Troubleshooting

### Common Language Data Issues

**Problem**: Language XP/levels showing identical values across different languages
- **Cause**: Cross-language data contamination in Redux state or localStorage
- **Solution**: Check `gameSlice.ts` loadPersistedState - ensure language-scoped loading
- **Prevention**: Always use `wordProgressStorage.load(languageCode)` instead of mixed loading

**Problem**: Data mixing after browser reload
- **Cause**: Storage persistence loading mixed data into Redux state
- **Solution**: Implement storage-level validation and language-specific state initialization
- **Debug**: Enable storage debug logging to trace data flow

**Problem**: XP/level in top navigation bar not updating when switching languages
- **Cause**: Navigation component using mixed Redux state instead of language-specific data
- **Solution**: Use `wordProgressStorage.load(currentLanguage)` instead of Redux `wordProgress`
- **Fix**: Ensures top bar always shows current language's XP and level

**Problem**: Word IDs colliding across languages
- **Cause**: Same numeric IDs (1, 2, 3) used across different language modules
- **Solution**: This is expected - language separation happens at storage level, not ID level
- **Important**: Never rely on word IDs alone - always include language context

### Data Management Tools

**User-Friendly Reset Options:**
1. Navigate to the **Profile page** (click "Manage Data" button on languages overview)
2. Scroll to the **Language Data Management** section
3. Choose your reset option:
   - **Reset All [Language]**: Completely resets all progress for a language
   - **Reset [Module Name]**: Resets progress for a specific module within a language

**Safety Features:**
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss
- Reset buttons are disabled when there's no progress to reset
- Automatic page reload ensures all components refresh with clean data

### Debug Tools
```javascript
// Browser console commands for debugging storage
localStorage.getItem('levelup_word_progress_de'); // Check German progress
localStorage.getItem('levelup_word_progress_es'); // Check Spanish progress

// Enable debug logging in development
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```
