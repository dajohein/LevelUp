/**
 * Analytics Performance Fix Summary
 * 
 * ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Analytics reloading multiple times per second during gameplay
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSES:
 * 1. SessionAnalytics component used in multiple places (SessionSelect mobile + desktop)
 * 2. Each instance triggers analytics reload on mount and language change
 * 3. Component may be re-mounting frequently during gameplay
 * 4. No caching mechanism to prevent redundant storage reads
 * 
 * FIXES APPLIED:
 * 1. Added 30-second cache duration to prevent excessive reloads in cacheService
 * 2. Optimized SessionAnalytics to only reload when truly necessary
 * 3. Added component-level data caching to reduce service calls
 * 4. Reduced analytics reload frequency from immediate to maximum once per 10 seconds
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
 * - Analytics reloads reduced from multiple per second to maximum 1 per 30 seconds
 * - Component re-renders minimized through better caching
 * - Storage I/O significantly reduced during gameplay
 * 
 * TESTING VERIFICATION:
 * - Monitor console logs for "ðŸ“Š Analytics reloaded from storage" frequency
 * - Should see maximum 1 reload per 30 seconds instead of multiple per second
 * - Gameplay should feel smoother with reduced background processing
