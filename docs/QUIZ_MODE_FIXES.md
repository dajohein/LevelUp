# Problems Identified and Fixed

## 1. ‚ùå Problem: Forced Multiple-Choice Override
**Location**: `src/components/QuizRenderer.tsx`  
**Issue**: Blanket forcing of multiple-choice mode for new words (0 XP), overriding intelligent service decisions.

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Hack that caused problems
if (isNewWord && quizModeToUse !== 'multiple-choice') {
    console.log(`üéØ [NEW WORD OVERRIDE] Forcing multiple-choice for new word "${wordToUse.term}" (was: ${quizModeToUse})`);
    quizModeToUse = 'multiple-choice';
}
```

**‚úÖ Solution**: Removed the hack, let services make intelligent decisions based on user mastery.

## 2. ‚ùå Problem: Empty Quiz Options
**Cause**: When quiz mode was forcefully changed, no options were generated for the new mode.
**Effect**: Empty multiple-choice cards with no selectable options.

**‚úÖ Solution**: Let services generate appropriate quiz modes with their options intact.

## 3. ‚ùå Problem: Poor Quick Dash Mode Selection  
**Location**: `src/services/quickDashService.ts`  
**Issue**: Only considered time pressure, ignored user mastery level with words.

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Only time pressure considered
private getSpeedOptimizedQuizMode(_word: Word, timePressure: number)
```

**‚úÖ Solution**: Updated to consider both time pressure AND word mastery:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Smart selection based on mastery + time pressure
private getSpeedOptimizedQuizMode(word: Word, timePressure: number) {
    const wordMastery = (word as any).currentMastery || 0;
    
    // New words (mastery < 20) get multiple-choice
    if (wordMastery < 20) return 'multiple-choice';
    
    // Progressive difficulty based on mastery and time pressure
    // ... intelligent logic ...
}
```

## 4. ‚úÖ Confirmed: Other Services Working Correctly

- **wordService.ts**: ‚úÖ Uses mastery-based mode selection (< 20 XP = multiple-choice)
- **deepDiveService.ts**: ‚úÖ Uses comprehension depth for educational progression  
- **streakChallengeService.ts**: ‚úÖ Uses streak tiers for progressive challenge
- **precisionModeService.ts**: ‚úÖ Uses error risk for confidence building

## 5. ‚úÖ Confirmed: Module-Scoped Options Working

Challenge service adapters now properly use module-scoped words from context:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Use context words (module-scoped when available)
const allWords = context.allWords || getWordsForLanguage(context.languageCode) || [];
```

# Result

- ‚úÖ **No more forced multiple-choice modes** - services make intelligent decisions
- ‚úÖ **No more empty quiz cards** - options are properly generated by services  
- ‚úÖ **Progressive difficulty** - quiz modes match user mastery level appropriately
- ‚úÖ **Module-scoped options** - multiple-choice answers come from same module
- ‚úÖ **Service-specific logic intact** - each challenge type uses appropriate difficulty logic

# Testing

The system now properly:
1. Shows multiple-choice for truly new words (< 20 mastery)
2. Progressively introduces harder modes as mastery increases
3. Respects each service's specific difficulty philosophy
4. Generates module-appropriate multiple-choice options
5. Eliminates infinite re-render loops and empty quiz cards

All services maintain their unique characteristics while following consistent mastery-based progression.
